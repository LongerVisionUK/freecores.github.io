{"name":"FreeCores","tagline":"A home for open source hardware cores","body":"### What is FreeCores?\r\n\r\nFreeCores is a fork of almost all cores that was once on OpenCores.org. This is to provide the benefit of using git, but also because the old OpenCores.org was all but abandoned by the owners.\r\n\r\n### Hacking\r\n\r\nFeel free to fork the projects here at your hearts content. Submit issues and pull requests! We're a small group of people, but we will try to keep the most popular cores up to date.\r\n\r\nIf you're the author of a core that we have, please let us know and we can add you as an member on that project.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nWhile not officially the support channel for FreeCores, jump into #openrisc on FreeNode and we will assist you.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
